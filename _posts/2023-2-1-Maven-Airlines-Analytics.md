The Airlines Customer Satisfaction Dashboard is a personal project that utilizes business intelligence analytics to gain insights into customer satisfaction across age groups for an airline carrier. By cleaning and merging data, the dashboard highlights areas for improvement, such as online booking and in-flight Wi-Fi, particularly for economy class customers. A
Likert chart simplifies survey response analysis. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for the airline to enhance services, monitor satisfaction, and make data-driven decisions for an improved travel experience.
